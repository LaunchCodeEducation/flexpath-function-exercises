## [Getting Started]

- include gifs here
- Include relevant steps to run exercise files or start the app
- "Open the file located at exercise-repo-name/whatever in VS Code"

- Also, include instructions on how to open their terminal in 

- WHILE DOING THIS, LOOK OUT FOR ANY POTENTIAL WINDOWS FILE PATH ISSUES in exercises


## Exercise overview

Give quick overview about context of exercises and their intention


## Specific exercises listed in numbered order

Add disclaimer if exercises are stored inside of specific files as comments

Also, for a plain text reference, theres always the `EXERCISE-INSTRUCTIONS` files to pop open

To answer questions that don't require coding, please create a file in the repo named 
[exercise_number_answer].txt.

For example, if in one of the exercise repos question 13 just asked a question to explain a programming concept, store your answer inside of a new file named exercise_13_answer.txt.

## Testing / Verification

Include relevant details here about where solution files are stored

### Summary of JavaScript Concepts Covered in These Exercises

1. **Functions**:
    
    - Function declarations and naming conventions.
    - Function expressions and their uses.
    - Arrow functions and how they differ from traditional functions.
    - Using functions to validate and transform data.
    - Function parameters, including default values.
2. **Scope**:
    
    - Understanding local and global scope.
    - How function scope works and how variables are limited to the scope they are defined in.
3. **Higher-Order Functions**:
    
    - Functions that return other functions.
    - Using higher-order functions to create dynamic validation functions.
4. **Recursion**:
    
    - Concepts and use cases for recursive functions.
    - Avoiding infinite loops with proper base cases.
5. **Looping and Iterating**:
    
    - Using `forEach` to iterate over arrays.
    - Replacing traditional loops with functional approaches.
    - Filtering arrays with `filter` and finding elements with `find`.
6. **Memory Management**:
    
    - How JavaScript handles primitives and objects differently in memory.
    - Reference types and how they are passed around.
7. **Data Collection Manipulation**:
    
    - Working with arrays using methods like `forEach`, `filter`, and `find`.
    - Using `Object.entries` to iterate over object properties.
